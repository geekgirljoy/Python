# Python
Examples of my Python Code

Essentially this repository is an ever growing backup of all my public Python work. It represents a living body of work and I can, will and do update it frequently.

## Python Projects

### [Blender](Projects/Blender)

Blender python scripts.

###### [ColorfulCubes.py](Projects/Blender/ColorfulCubes.py)

### [NxNequals](Projects/NxNequals)
I found that I needed the "times tables" precomputed and saved as newline delimited strings for a project that I am working on so I created NxNequals.py to generate the .dat files for me. It will generate output that includes the equation 'n times n equals sum' as well as simply the resulting sum in a different file depending on if the third parameter (equation) is set to True or False

###### [NxNequals.py](Projects/NxNequals/NxNequals.py)
###### [Example output with equation](Projects/NxNequals/89Times(n)Equations.dat)
###### [Example output without equation](Projects/NxNequals/89Times(n).dat)



## Loose Code
This folder contains stand alone code. Each does something different and is here because I want a backup of this code for any number of reasons.
